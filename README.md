### What Is A DDos-Attack

## A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is an attempt to make an online service unavailable 

by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources. They target a wide variety of important resources

from banks to news websites, and present a major challenge to making sure people can publish and access important information
